a. I had obstacles in determining whether the <P> was a word portion, a stand alone word, if it came after multiple <P>s before it, or if it started or ended the entire input. 
b. there are two functions that make up my code:

writeToFile -> takes in word portions and writes them into outf:
    if (word portion is <P>)
        if only a portion, print it
        else indicate new paragraph needed
    if new paragraph needed, print it

    if word-portion too long to fit but doesnt need wraping:
        print it
        return 0
    if we aren't at the start:
        print white spaces
    if word-portion needs wrap: 
        print it with wraping
        return 2
    else, word portion is standard:
        print it
    return 0

arrange -> reads character by character, creating a word-portion to send to writeToFile:
    if (lineLength to small) return 1;
    output[] -> buffer to hold word-portion
    numAddedSpaces -> stores how many spaces needed before a word-portion
    prevC -> previous character

    while (takes in character) {
        if char is whitespace:
            if output isn't nothing:
                writeToFile()
                updates numAddedSpaces
                reset word
        else if char is '-':
            add '-' to output
            writeToFile();
            update numAddedSpaces
            reset word
        else, char is a normal char:
            add char to output
        update prevC
    }
    write whatever is left in buffer
    add newline to ended

    return returnValue

c. Test cases

lineLength = 10, standard test: "Test test testing please work please." 
lineLength = 10, multiple lines and multiple spaces: " \n  \n Test test testing \n  \n \n please work  \n  \n   please.   \n " 
lineLength = 0, length too short: "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH" 
lineLength = -5, length too short: "AAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH"

lineLength = 40, word too long: "    bla bla bla    bla bla bla       \n \n     aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa (30 long) "
lineLength = 40, word extra too long: "    bla bla bla    bla bla bla       \n \n     
\n aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa (120 long) "

lineLength = 10, word portions: "    bla-bla-bla-bla-bla-bla-bla-bla   \n ---bla. b---la \n bla-b---.  \n bl.a -- hi-there.   my-name-is-josua. \n      PERIOD-period"

lineLength = 10, punctuation: "weee. period PERIOD. \n not period? \n \n  not a period woah! . . . . . . . . . .  \n huh"

lineLength = 20, new paragraphs: "<P> <P> <P> <P> NEW  <P>  <P> <P>    \n \n <P>   \n  PARA <P>  <P>  GRAPH GRAPH GRAPH <P> <P> <P> <P> "

lineLength = 0, no word: ""

lineLength = 0, just whitespace: "    \n   \n \n \n
