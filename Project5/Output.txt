a.  I had
obstacles
in determi
ning
whether
the

was a
word
portion,
a stand
alone
word, if
it came
after
multiple
<P>s
before
it, or if
it
started
or ended
the
entire
input.
b.  there
are two
functions
that make
up my
code:  wri
teToFile
-> takes
in word
portions
and
writes
them into
outf:  if
(word
portion
is <P>)
if only a
portion,
print it
else
indicate
new
paragraph
needed if
new
paragraph
needed,
print it
if word-
portion
too long
to fit
but
doesnt
need
wraping:
print it
return 0
if we
aren't at
the
start:
print
white
spaces if
word-
portion
needs
wrap:
print it
with
wraping
return 2
else,
word
portion
is
standard:
print it
return 0
arrange -
> reads
character
by
character,
creating
a word-
portion
to send
to writeTo
File:  if 
(lineLengt
h to
small)
return 1;
output[]
-> buffer
to hold
word-
portion nu
mAddedSpac
es ->
stores
how many
spaces
needed
before a
word-
portion
prevC ->
previous
character
while
(takes in
character)
{ if char
is whitesp
ace:  if
output
isn't
nothing:  
writeToFil
e()
updates nu
mAddedSpac
es reset
word else
if char
is '-':
add '-'
to output 
writeToFil
e();
update num
AddedSpace
s reset
word
else,
char is a
normal
char:
add char
to output
update
prevC }
write
whatever
is left
in buffer
add
newline
to ended
return ret
